# Gomer in Vue

Gomer is a Pomodoro Technique influenced time tracker. This was inspired by my time at Dev Bootcamp. Many in the cohort would use this technique to stay motivated and make sure we were concentrating on the project at hand. The only thing I believed we were missing was somewhere to take notes, or add a to do for later, or just a reminder. That is what I set out to accomplish with Gomer.

Created with HTML, Javascript, CSS, Vue, Materialize and a little love.
